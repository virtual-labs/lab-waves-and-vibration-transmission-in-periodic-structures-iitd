  "objective": "Metamaterial and periodic structures are attracting attention of the researchers due to its unusual phenomena. However, the research on metamaterial originated from solid-state physics and optics, now it started making its indispensable role in the field related to applied mechanics, vibration control, aerospace, seismic and acoustic engineering etc. To familiarize the students with this cutting edge research field, this course will play a pivotal role. </br>Wave propagation through different forms of 1D and 2D continuum will be discussed elaborately. Concept of negative material properties such as negative effective mass, stiffness or Poissonâ€™s ratio will also be introduced within the scope of the proposed course. ",
